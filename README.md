## 🧑‍💻 About the Project

**Portfolio Maker** is a clean, modern, and fully responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase your skills, projects, and professional experience in a visually compelling way. Built entirely with semantic HTML5 and CSS3 — no JavaScript frameworks, no build tools, no bloat.

Whether you're a developer, designer, or student, this portfolio template gives you a professional online presence that loads fast, looks great on all devices, and is easy to customize.

### 💡 Why I Built This

In a world flooded with over-engineered portfolio templates, I wanted something different — a portfolio that:

- **Loads instantly** without heavy JS bundles
- **Works on every device** from mobile to 4K monitors
- **Is easy to maintain** — just edit one HTML file
- **Looks professional** without sacrificing simplicity
- **Costs nothing to host** — deploys free on GitHub Pages
